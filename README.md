## Enderstand command line interpreter 🤔

### How to Start a Command Interpreter ?

#### 1. Access the Terminal/Command Prompt
- On Windows, you can open the Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the Start menu.
- On macOS, open the Terminal application, typically found in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" directory.
- On Linux, you can access the command-line interface by opening the Terminal application or using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+T). 

### 2. Login
- If required, you may need to log in with a username and password, depending on your system configuration.

### 3. Choose a Shell
- In most cases, the default shell (e.g., Bash on Linux, Command Prompt on Windows) will start automatically. You can also switch to different shells if installed (e.g., Zsh)

### How to Use a Command Interpreter ?
Once you have the command interpreter open, you can start issuing commands. Here are some basic commands and how to use them.

#### Navigating the File System
- **cd** /path/to/directory
- **ls** (List files and directories in the current directory) 
...
#### Manipulating Files and Directories
- **mkdir** myDirectoryName (Create a new directory)
- **touch** my_file.extensionOrNot (To create a file)
- **rm** my_bad_file.txt (Delete a file)
- **rm** -r directoryName (Remove a directory with all childs)
 
#### Running Programs
ou can run programs and scripts by typing their names. For example, to run a Python script:
- python my_best_script.py

#### Piping and Redirection
ou can use | to pipe the output of one command as input to another. For example, to search for a specific term in a file:
- **cat** my_file.txt | grep "search_term"

You can redirect output to a file using `>`
- **ls** > file_list.txt

#### Viewing Files
You can use commands like cat, more, or less to view the contents of a text file:
- **cat** my_file.txt
